# YAPCA Registration System

YAPCA - the Young Artists Pre-College Academy is a not-for-profit chamber music and performance school that offers kids from 8-18 opportunities to develop their orchestral, chamber music and performance abilities. 

This project is the code for the student registration system. You may use it in any way you wish, with or without attribution. Much of the code is specific to YAPCA's needs, but I'm confident that it could be adapted to other schools and organizations.
